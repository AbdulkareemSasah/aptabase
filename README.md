# Aptabase Self-Hosting Guide

This guide will help you get started with self hosting Aptabase. 
You can alternatively use our [Cloud Hosting](https://aptabase.com) for a zero maintenance and fully managed solution.

## Prerequisites

All you need is to have a recent version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) as this guide uses Docker Compose.

## How-to

1. Clone this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aptabase/self-hosting
```

2. Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to your liking, but especially the sections with comments as the default values are just dummy examples.

3. Run the following command to start the services:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

4. That's it! You can now access Aptabase at `http://localhost:8000` ðŸŽ‰

> If that's not working, please check the logs with `docker-compose logs -f` and make sure there are no errors.
